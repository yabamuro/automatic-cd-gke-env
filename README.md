### 1. Preface
The default machine type of nodes in GKE is n1-standard-1 the number of it is 3.
Therefore the monthly amount would be as bellows if you unconsciously use the defaula enviroment and carelessly forget to eliminate resources.

It might be a tiny bit of expensive for individuals

### 2. Architecture
The Architecutre is as bellows. This development enviroment is available from 19:00 to 26:00(Weekdays) and 14:00-26:00(Holidays)
It's just one example and you can choose any period by changing the cron configuration of Cloud Scheduler.

### 3. Procedure(You can execute following procedures via cloud-shell)
#### 3.0. Adjust configurations for your GCP projects
- Write your GCP project name to $YOUR_PROJECT in following files.
```
create_env.sh
delete_env.sh
```
#### 3.1. Cloud Pub/Sub ‚Üí Cloud Run
- Build the Docker images
```
docker build -f Dockerfile_c -t gcr.io/$YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/create-k8s-dev-env ./
docker build -f Dockerfile_d -t gcr.io/$YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/delete-k8s-dev-env ./
```
- Push these images to Container Registry
```
docker push gcr.io/$YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/create-k8s-dev-env
docker push gcr.io/$YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/delete-k8s-dev-env
```
- Creat The Service of Cloud Run by using the above images.
    - Creat The Service of Cloud Run(The case of create-k8s-dev-env is described as bellows. ( Do the same thing for delete-k8s-dev-env) )

<img width="747" alt="choosebuild" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32224266/80118771-d3fe5980-85c3-11ea-9937-859e9a57e41e.png">

- Associate the CloudRun with CloudPubSub(The case of create-k8s-dev-env is described as bellows. ( Do the same thing for delete-k8s-dev-env) )
<img width="793" alt="pubsubrun" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32224266/80121278-107f8480-85c7-11ea-8ffe-7b37fba3ad5d.png">

#### 3.2. Cloud Pub/Sub ‚Üí Cloud Function(Option for Slack notification)
- Create the function of Cloud Function by inserting following python scripts.(Python3.7)
    - Describe the Webhook URL as SLACK_URL into the Environment variables in Cloud Function
```
notification-create-k8s-dev-env.py
notification-delete-k8s-dev-env.py
```
- Associate the Cloud Function with CloudPubSub(The case of create-k8s-dev-env is described as bellows. ( Do the same thing for delete-k8s-dev-env) )

#### 3.3. Cloud Scheduler ‚Üí Cloud Pub/Sub
- Associate the CloudPubSub with Cloud Scheduler(You can choose any period by changing the cron configuration of Cloud Scheduler.)

### 4. Conclusion
In this architecture, construction of nodes are 2 n1-standard-1(preemptive) and 1 f1-micro(ALL-FREE)
By assuming that you use this enviroment after your work, This development enviroment is available from 19:00 to 26:00(Weekdays) and 14:00-26:00(Holidays)
